# javascript-challenge

I really enjoyed this homework because I am interested in UFO sitings and have had a few of my own. I followed examples from our activities in week 14 to get my level-1 JS code. I did this in a step by step fashion until I had concise code that looped through the data, added the table rows, and finally added the data to the appended rows.

I struggled with the level-2 part of this assignment. I was able to create the multiple filter buttons but was unable to get them to run and filter the data correctly initially. But with a little help from BCS Learning Assistant I was able to resolve the problem and now both Level-1 and Level-2 is working :)!
